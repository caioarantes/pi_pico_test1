temp_blink.py - Adjusting LED Blinking Frequency Using the Built-in Temperature Sensor
This script uses the built-in temperature sensor to control the blinking frequency of the onboard LED. Simply placing your finger on the sensor can increase the frequency from 1-5 Hz to as high as 100 Hz, where the LED may appear continuously lit due to the high speed. For different temperature ranges, modify the frequency-temperature model parameters accordingly.

alarm.py - Temperature Alarm with Buzzer and Built-in LED
This script triggers an alarm when the temperature exceeds a specified threshold. You can adjust the temperature threshold as needed. The alarm will automatically stop once the temperature drops back below the threshold.
